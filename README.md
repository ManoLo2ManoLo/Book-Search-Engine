## Description
In this application, the user can create an account to manolo's book search engine. A user without an account is able to search for books, and get a list of books. As a signed in user, you are able to save the books to a personal list. You are able to view a list of your saved books in your own dashboard. If you would like to remove the book, there is a delete saved book button on the bottom of that book's summary.
